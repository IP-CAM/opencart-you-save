@tik You Save

Purpose
=======

If you are running any promotions (Specials in OpenCart parlance), then it is a great idea to tell the customers not only what the regular and special prices are, but also what they are saving.

Following the example of Amazon, this extension add a savings notice "You save: $x (y%)" below the price on product page.

Because this is a vQmod, no core files are touched, and the changes should carry over to the next version.
